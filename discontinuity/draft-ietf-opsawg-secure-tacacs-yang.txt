1.  Introduction

   The System Management data model [RFC7317] defines separate
   functionality to support local and Remote Authentication Dial In User
   Service (RADIUS) authentication:

   User Authentication Model:  Defines a list of user names with
      associated passwords and a configuration leaf to decide the order
      in which local or RADIUS authentication is used.

   RADIUS Client Model:  Defines a list of RADIUS servers used by a
      device for centralized user authentication.

   [RFC9105] defines a YANG module ("ietf-system-tacacs-plus") that
   augments the System Management data model [RFC7317] for the
   management of Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus
   (TACACS+) clients as an alternative to RADIUS servers [RFC2865].
   Typically, the "ietf-system-tacacs-plus" module is used to configure
   a TACACS+ client on a device to support deployment scenarios with
   centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting servers.

   This document defines a YANG module for managing TACACS+ clients
   (Section 4), including TACACS+ over TLS 1.3 clients
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13].  This document obsoletes [RFC9105].

   The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

1.1.  Changes Since RFC 9105

   The following changes have been made to [RFC9105]:

   *  Add support for TLS [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13]

   *  Add a constraint to ensure that the list of servers is unique per
      address/port number

   *  Update the description of 'address' to be consistent with the type

   *  Fix a must statement under 'tacacs-plus'

   *  Fix errors in the example provided in Appendix A of [RFC9105]

   *  Add an example to illustrate the use of VRF

   *  Add new examples to illustrate the use of TACACS+TLS data nodes

   Detailed YANG changes are listed in Section 4.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is defined in
   [RFC7950].

   The document uses the terms defined in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13] and Section 3 of [RFC8907].

   'client' refers to TACACS+ client, while 'server' refers to TACACS+
   server.

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   The tree diagram used in this document follows the notation defined
   in [RFC8340].

3.  Design of the TACACS+ Data Model

   This module is used to configure a TACACS+ client on a device to
   support deployment scenarios with centralized authentication,
   authorization, and accounting servers.  Authentication is used to
   validate a user's username and password, authorization allows the
   user to access and execute commands at various privilege levels
   assigned to the user, and accounting keeps track of the activity of a
   user who has accessed the device.

   The "ietf-system-tacacs-plus" module augments the '/sys:system' path
   defined in the "ietf-system" module with the contents of the 'tacacs-
   plus' grouping.  Therefore, a device can use local, RADIUS, or
   TACACS+ authentication to validate users who attempt to access the
   device by several mechanisms, e.g., a command line interface or a
   web-based user interface.

   The 'server' list, which is directly under the 'tacacs-plus'
   container, holds a list of TACACS+ servers and uses 'server-type' to
   distinguish between Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
   (AAA) services.  The list of servers is for redundancy.

   When there are multiple interfaces connected to a TACACS+ client or
   server, the source address of outgoing TACACS+ packets could be
   specified, or the source address could be specified through the
   interface IP address setting or derived from the outbound interface
   from the local Forwarding Information Base (FIB).  For a TACACS+
   server located in a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a VPN Routing and
   Forwarding (VRF) instance needs to be specified.

   The 'statistics' container under the 'server' list is a collection of
   read-only counters for sent and received messages from a configured
   server.

   The YANG module for TACACS+ client has the structure shown in
   Figure 1.

                     Figure 1: Tree Structure Overview

   Specifically, the module is designed to cover the following key
   requirements specified in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13]:

   *  TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] MUST be used for transport.

   *  Earlier TLS versions TLS MUST NOT be used.

   *  The cipher suites offered or accepted SHOULD be configurable.

   *  Implementations MAY support Raw Public Keys and PSK.

   *  Implementations MUST support the ability to configure the server's
      domain name, so that it may be included in the TLS Server Name
      Indication (SNI) extension.

   The following new data nodes are supported compared to [RFC9105]:

   'client-credentials' and 'server-credentials':  Defines a set
      credentials that can be globally provisioned and then referenced
      under specific servers.

   'domain-name':  Provides a domain name of the server per Section 3.3
      of [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13].  This is the TLS TACACS+
      server's domain name that is included in the SNI extension.  This
      domain name is distinct from the IP address/hostname used for the
      underlying transport connection.

   'sni-enabled':  Controls activation of Server Name Indication (SNI)
      (Section 3 of [RFC6066]).  This parameter can be used only if a
      domain name is provided.

   'client-identity':  Specifies the identity credentials that the
      client may present when establishing a connection to a server.
      Client identities can be configured at the top level and then
      referenced for specific server instances.  Alternatively, client
      identities can be configured explicitely under each server
      instance.

   'server-authentication':  Specifies how a client authenticates
      servers.  Server credentials can be configured at the top level
      and then referenced for specific server instances.  Alternatively,
      client identities can be configured explicitely under each server
      instance.

   'hello-params':  Controls TLS versions and cipher suites.

   'discontinuity-time':  The time on the most recent occasion at which
      the client suffered a discontinuity (a configuration action to
      reset all counters, re-initialization, etc.).

   'cert-errors':  Number of connection failures due to certificate
      issues.

   'rpk-errors':  Number of raw public key related connection failures.

4.  TACACS+ Client Module

   This YANG module uses types and groupings defined in [RFC6991],
   [RFC8341], [RFC8343], [RFC8529], [RFC9640], [RFC9641], [RFC9642], and
   [RFC9645].

   The module augments [RFC7317].

   The module also cites [RFC6520], [RFC9257], and [RFC9258].

          Also, this revision:
            - updates the reference of 'tacacs-plus' identity
              to also cite RFC SSSS
            - fixes a must statement under 'tacacs-plus' by adding
              a missing prefix
            - requires that the servers list must be unique per
              address/port number.
            - updates the description of the 'name' under 'server'
              list to better reflect the intended use and clarifies
              the difference with the new domain-name
            - updates the description of the 'address' to be
              consistent with the type
            - removes the default statement for the 'port' under
              'server' list because a distinct default port number
              is used for TACACS+TLS
            - updates the 'port' leaf under 'server' list to enumerate
              the various TACACS+ default port numbers
            - added a constraint on the VRF with 'source-interface'

            - updates the description of timeout to remove redundant
              text with the default statement";

5.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-ac-common" YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have to
   use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and
   QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
   nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
   have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   'server':  This list contains the data nodes used to control the
      TACACS+ servers used by the device.  Unauthorized access to this
      list could enable an attacker to assume complete control over the
      device by pointing to a compromised TACACS+ server, or to modify
      the counters to hide attacks against the device.

   'shared-secret':  This leaf controls the key known to both the
      TACACS+ client and server.  Unauthorized access to this leaf could
      make the device vulnerable to attacks; therefore, it has been
      restricted using the "default-deny-all" access control defined in
      [RFC8341].  When setting, it is highly recommended that the leaf
      is at least 32 characters long and sufficiently complex with a mix
      of different character types, i.e., upper case, lower case,
      numeric, and punctuation.

   'client-identity' and 'server-authentication':  Any modification to a
      key or reference to a key may dramatically alter the implemented
      security policy.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-
      deny-write" has been set.

   This YANG module uses groupings from other YANG modules that define
   nodes that may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in network
   environments.  Refer to Section 5.3 of [RFC9642] and Section 5.3 of
   [RFC9645] for information as to which nodes may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the following URI in the "ns" subregistry
   within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-tacacs-plus
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group:

      Name:  ietf-system-tacacs-plus
      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-tacacs-plus
      Prefix:  sys-tcs-plus
      Maintained by IANA?  N
      Reference:  RFC XXXX

Appendix B.  TACACS+TLS Examples

   This section provides examples to illustrate the configuration of
   TACACS+TLS clients.

   These examples follow the convention used in Section 1.5 of [RFC9645]
   for binary data that has been base64 encoded.

B.1.  Example TACACS+ Authentication Configuration with Explicit
      Certificate Definitions

   Figure 4 shows a configuration example with 'inline-definition' for
   the client identity and server authentication.

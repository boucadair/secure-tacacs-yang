I have some specific comments and nits, though:\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\ns/This modules augments/This module augments/\r\n\r\nSection 1:\r\n\r\nDo you need to state that the first version of this spec used a pruning approach?  Ultimately, when this is published that won\u2019t matter.\r\n\r\nIn the module itself, I\u2019d like a few abbreviations expanded in the descriptions:\r\n\r\nleaf target-kdf \uf0e8 expand KDF\r\n\r\ncontainer ca-certs \uf0e8 expand CA (yeah, I know)\r\n\r\ncontainer ee-certs \uf0e8 expand EE\r\n\r\nWhy do you define a new grouping, tcp-server-info?  Why not just augment what is in 9105?  This adds complexity with minimal, if any, benefit that I see.\r\n\r\nDoes the new domain-name leaf need to be mandatory if certs are used?\r\n\r\nFinally, on operational data, should this module introduce any TLS-specific stats in addition to those in 9105?  I feel like certificate issues or PSK problems might be useful.\r\n\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n```",

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG module for managing Terminal Access
   Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) over TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13].  The module is designed as an
   augmentation to the "ietf-system-tacacs-plus" module specified in
   [RFC9105].

   The module uses the TLS grouping defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-tls-client-server].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   The document uses the terms defined in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13] and Section 3 of [RFC8907].

4.  YANG Module

5.  Security Considerations

   This section uses the template described in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   Specifically, the following subtrees and data nodes have particular
   sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   'xxx':  xxxx.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   'xxx':  xxxx.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-secure-tacacs
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group:

      Name:  ietf-system-secure-tacacs
      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-secure-tacacs
      Prefix:  secure-tacacs
      Maintained by IANA?  N
      Reference:  RFC XXXX

--- abstract

   This document defines a Terminal Access Controller Access-Control
   System Plus (TACACS+) client YANG module that augments the System
   Management data model, defined in RFC 7317, to allow devices to make
   use of TACACS+ servers for centralized Authentication, Authorization,
   and Accounting (AAA). Specifically, this document defines a YANG module for TACACS+ over TLS 1.3.

   This document obsoletes RFC 9105.

#  Introduction

{{?RFC9105}} defines a YANG module ("ietf-system-tacacs-plus") that augments the System Management data model defined in {{!RFC7317}} for the management of Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) clients. Typically, the "ietf-system-tacacs-plus" module is used to configure a TACACS+ client on a device to support deployment scenarios with centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting servers.

This document defines a YANG module for managing TACACS+ client, including TACACS+ over TLS 1.3 clients {{!I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13}}. This document obsoletes {{?RFC9105}}.

The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in {{!RFC8342}}.

## Changes Since RFC 9105

   The following changes have been made to {{?RFC9105}}:

   * Add support for TLS

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is defined in
   {{!RFC7950}}.

The document uses the terms defined in {{Section 2 of !I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13}} and {{Section 3 of ?RFC8907}}.

'client' refers to TACACS+ client, while 'server' refers to TACACS+ server.

## Tree Diagrams

   The tree diagram used in this document follows the notation defined
   in {{?RFC8340}}.

# Design of the TACACS+ Data Model

   This module is used to configure a TACACS+ client on a device to
   support deployment scenarios with centralized authentication,
   authorization, and accounting servers.  Authentication is used to
   validate a user's username and password, authorization allows the
   user to access and execute commands at various privilege levels
   assigned to the user, and accounting keeps track of the activity of a
   user who has accessed the device.

   The ietf-system-tacacs-plus module augments the "/sys:system" path
   defined in the ietf-system module with the contents of the "tacacs-
   plus" grouping.  Therefore, a device can use local, RADIUS, or
   TACACS+ authentication to validate users who attempt to access the
   router by several mechanisms, e.g., a command line interface or a
   web-based user interface.

   The "server" list, which is directly under the "tacacs-plus"
   container, holds a list of TACACS+ servers and uses server-type to
   distinguish between Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
   (AAA) services.  The list of servers is for redundancy.

   When there are multiple interfaces connected to the TACACS+ client or
   server, the source address of outgoing TACACS+ packets could be
   specified, or the source address could be specified through the
   interface IP address setting or derived from the outbound interface
   from the local Forwarding Information Base (FIB).  For the TACACS+
   server located in a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a VPN Routing and
   Forwarding (VRF) instance needs to be specified.

   The "statistics" container under the "server list" is a collection of
   read-only counters for sent and received messages from a configured
   server.

   The YANG module for TACACS+ client has the following structure:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include-fold ./trees/tree-overview.txt}
~~~~~~~~~~

The module is designed to cover the following key requirements specified in {{!I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13}}:

* TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} MUST be used for transport.
* Earlier TLS versions TLS MUST NOT be used.
* The cipher suites offered or accepted SHOULD be configurable.
* Implementations MAY support Raw Public Keys and PSK.
* Implementations MUST support the ability to configure the server's domain name

The following new data nodes are supported compared to {{?RFC9105}}:

'client-credentials' and 'server-credentials':
: Defines a set credentials that can be globally provisioned and then referenced under specific servers.

'domain-name':
: Provides a domain name of the server per {{Section 3.3 of !I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs-tls13}}.

'client-identity':
: Specifies the identity credentials that the client may present when
  establishing a connection to a server. Client identities can be configured at the top level and then referenced for specific server instances. Alternatively, client identities can be configured explicitely under each server instance.

'server-authentication':
: Specifies how a client authenticates servers. Server credentials can be configured at the top level and then referenced for specific server instances. Alternatively, client identities can be configured explicitely under each server instance.

'hello-params':
: Controls TLS versions and cipher suites.

'keepalives':
: Providers a set of parameters for testing the aliveness of the server.

# TACACS+ Client Module

This module uses types and groupings defined in {{!RFC6991}}, {{!RFC8341}}, {{!RFC8343}}, {{!RFC8529}}, {{!RFC9640}}, {{!RFC9641}},
{{!RFC9642}}, and {{!RFC9645}}.

The module augments {{!RFC7317}}.

The module also cites {{!RFC9257}}, {{!RFC9258}}, {{!RFC9258}}, and {{!RFC6520}}.

# Security Considerations

This section is modeled after the template described in {{Section 3.7 of ?I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis}}.

The "ietf-ac-common" YANG module defines a data model that is
designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
NETCONF {{?RFC6241}} and RESTCONF {{?RFC8040}}. These protocols have to
use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH {{?RFC4252}}, TLS {{?RFC8446}}, and
QUIC {{?RFC9000}}) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}}
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   Specifically, the following subtrees and data nodes have particular
   sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   /system/tacacs-plus/server:
   :  This list contains the data nodes used
      to control the TACACS+ servers used by the device.  Unauthorized
      access to this list could enable an attacker to assume complete
      control over the device by pointing to a compromised TACACS+
      server, or to modify the counters to hide attacks against the
      device.

   /system/tacacs-plus/server/shared-secret:
   :  This leaf controls the key
      known to both the TACACS+ client and server.  Unauthorized access
      to this leaf could make the device vulnerable to attacks;
      therefore, it has been restricted using the "default-deny-all"
      access control defined in {{!RFC8341}}.  When setting, it is highly
      recommended that the leaf is at least 32 characters long and
      sufficiently complex with a mix of different character types,
      i.e., upper case, lower case, numeric, and punctuation.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

     'xxx':
     :  xxxx.

   This YANG module uses groupings from other YANG modules that
   define nodes that may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in network environments. Refer to {{Section 5.3 of !RFC9645.}} for information as to which nodes may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.
